i deleted both the zip archive and the actual folder right before sanitising to upload. oops.
had the editor opened and it preserved the main files in memory. the rest was the sample dataset and screenshots of the plots it produced

here as a testament to both my amazing luck and also that i do know how to research and program to a reasonably deep degree until it starts slipping from my actual degree and into applied maths territory.

they say computer science is a kind of maths. and perhaps it is so. i tried to read the famous Turing proof paper and went mildly insane for a bit. the field has advanced so far i haven't done much algebra that isn't like, sizes and colour blend percentages, perhaps array offsets. a trade and a science, the latter of which i want very little with.

...also almost deleted this file as i was editing it via moving two fingers too far on the touchpad. did you know github keeps local uncommitted changes saved sometimes?
